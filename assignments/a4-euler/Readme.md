Starting with a randomly selected cube, cubes beginning rotating 45 degrees in one second. Color is interpolated from the initial color to a final color as the cubes rotate. Cubes beginning rotating when a directly adjacent cube is halfway through their rotation. Once all the cubes are fininished, a new starting cube and ending color are chosen randomly.
