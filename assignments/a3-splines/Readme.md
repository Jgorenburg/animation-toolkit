# Curve-Editor

Curve editor draws a curve using either a linear, catmull-rom, or hermite curve. If "c" is pressed, the control points are shown. Linear curve is in blue, catmull-rom in red, and hermite in green.

# Rollercoaster

My unique project was building a rainbow rollercoaster using a hermite curve. The lead car gets a new position every call of scene and the remaining cars get the preceding one. I takes 15 seconds to complete the loop with varying speeds simulating the effects of gravity within the loop.

(It's very choppy, I think just because my computer is slow)
