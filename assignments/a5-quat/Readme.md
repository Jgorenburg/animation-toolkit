Starting with the top-left cube, cubes beginning rotating 180 degrees in a random axis over 1 second. Color is interpolated from the initial color to a final color as the cubes rotate. Cubes beginning rotating 0.2 seconds after the one before it. Once all the cubes are fininished, a new color is chosen and the process repeats.
