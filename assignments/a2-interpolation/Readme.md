# Readme

# Gradient

Gradient where the squares are too small to see the divides between them.

# Draw Cubic

Pressing 1 uses Bernstein's method to draw a bezier curve in red. 2 makes the same curve in purple using Castlejau's algorithm.

# Cubic Motion

A sphere travels along a curve for 5 seconds. The spheres color interpolates from red to blue while traveling.

# Screensaver

Continously interpolates between two curves. It takes 2 seconds to reach the next curve and generates intermediate curves every .02 seconds, so there are 50 curves between endpoints.

# Growing Curves

These curves grow over the course of a 5 seconds and then crumble from the initial end over another 5 seconds. Each curve grows between 0 and 2 children (except the first, which makes 3). Curves begin with the color of their parent at the time of their creation and interpolate to a unique color.
