# Full Length CCD Chain

My unique project was to implement a full-length CCD chain between any point on the skeleton and the right foot. Instead of just bending to the hips, the skeleton has the ability to bend from the foot if it needs to reach farther. This was implemented by using a regular CCD chain from the point to the hips, translating the hips to the correct location, and the using another CCD chain to return the right foot to the proper location. I implemented this in the ik_controller files instead of unique.

Along the way I created superman (aka what happens when the foot isn't anchored)
